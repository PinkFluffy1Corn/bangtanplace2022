overlay for r/place


install Tampermokey in Chrome and add the script to it, to show the overlay on the canvas.
The script basically adds an image on top of the canvas. The image for the overlay, as well as individual images for some of the parts are included in this repo. If new changes don't show, try switching between "overlay.png" and "overlay-2.png" in the script to get around caching.

Included in this overlay: ARMY logo with ARMY bomb at (250, 685), hot air balloon including the Jelle logo of our ally (1987, 237) and the whale design (1943,1198) with the nutcracker of our ally to the left of it.
