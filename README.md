overlay for r/place


install Tampermokey in Chrome and add the overlay.user.js script to it, to show the overlay on the canvas.
The script basically adds an image on top of the canvas. The image for the overlay, as well as individual images for some of the parts are included in this repo. If new changes don't show, try switching between "overlay-01.png" and "overlay-02.png" in the script to get around caching.
